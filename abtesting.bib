abstract = {A/B testing isn’t a buzz term. A lot of savvy marketers and designs are using it right now to gain insight into visitor behavior and to increase conversion rate. And yet A/B testing is still not as common as such Internet marketing subjects as SEO, Web analytics and usability. People just aren’t as aware of it. They don’t completely understand what it is or how it could benefit them or how they should use it. This article is meant to be the best guide you will ever need for A/B testing.},

@article{Crawford1990,
abstract = {Misrepresentation in research is clearly a problem today. In the environment of big science, with accelerating competition, increased rewards for discovery and uncertainties of long-range outcome, two important checks on quality control - peer review and the replication of results - are more difficult to accomplish effectively. Additionally, the new information technology now enables scientists to communicate outside established channels where their work is judged. However, it is argued that science is a self-correcting system and errors that are inadvertent or deliberate will be corrected over time. copyright 1990 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

@article{Hevner2004,
abstract = {Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

@article{Kohavi2009,
abstract = {The web provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate ideas quickly using controlled experiments, also called randomized experiments, A/B tests (and their generalizations), split tests, Control/Treatment tests, MultiVariable Tests (MVT) and parallel flights. Controlled experiments embody the best scientific design for establishing a causal relationship between changes and their influence on user-observable behavior. We provide a practical guide to conducting online experiments, where end-users can help guide the development of features. Our experience indicates that significant learning and return-on-investment (ROI) are seen when development teams listen to their customers, not to the Highest Paid Person’s Opinion (HiPPO). We provide several examples of controlled experiments with surprising results. We review the important ingredients of running controlled experiments, and discuss their limitations (both technical and organizational). We focus on several areas that are critical to experimentation, including statistical power, sample size, and techniques for variance reduction. We describe common architectures for experimentation systems and analyze their advantages and disadvantages. We evaluate randomization and hashing techniques, which we show are not as simple in practice as is often assumed. Controlled experiments typically generate large amounts of data, which can be analyzed using data mining techniques to gain deeper understanding of the factors influencing the outcome of interest, leading to new hypotheses and creating a virtuous cycle of improvements. Organizations that embrace controlled experiments with clear evaluation criteria can evolve their systems with automated optimizations and real-time analyses. Based on our extensive practical experience with multiple systems and organizations, we share key lessons that will help practitioners in running trustworthy controlled experiments.},

@book{Seufert2014,
abstract = {This chapter, “Growth,” explores all means by which a freemium product can expand its user base. The chapter begins with an introduction to strategic growth, which is a data-driven approach to optimizing a product’s reach through market research, and the degree to which users are retained in the earliest stages of product interaction. This retention focus is often accomplished with the onboarding funnel (sometimes called the tutorial funnel); onboarding is a highly analytical, highly granular process to ensure that the first few minutes of a user’s introduction to a product are optimized for retention. The chapter then leads to a discussion on paid user acquisition, which is the means by which a product is advertised. This section outlines the various components of an advertising system: the advertising exchange, the supply-side platform, and the demand-side platform. Paid search is also described in detail. The chapter concludes with a description of alternative user acquisition techniques and the means by which they are employed in freemium products. Alternative user acquisition encompasses traditional media advertising, search engine optimization, and the three forms of non-paid user acquisition: discovery, cross-promotion, and virality.},
